name = "fork-incomplete-markers"
description = '''
The root cause the resolver to fork over `a`, but the markers on the variant
of `a` don't cover the entire marker space, they are missing Python 3.10.
Later, we have a dependency this very hole, which we still need to select,
instead of having two forks around but without Python 3.10 and omitting
`c` from the solution.
