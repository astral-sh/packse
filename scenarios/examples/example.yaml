  description: This is an example scenario written in YAML, in which the user depends on a single
    package `a` which requires `b`.
  expected:
    satisfiable: true
    packages:
      a: 1.0.0
      b: 2.0.0
    explanation: The latest valid version of `b` should be installed. `b==3.0.0` is
      not valid because it requires `c` which does not exist.
  root:
    requires:
    - a
  packages:
    a:
      versions:
        1.0.0:
          requires:
          - b>1.0.0
    b:

        1.0.0: {}
        2.0.0: {}
